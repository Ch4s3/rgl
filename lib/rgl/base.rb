  # In BGL terminology the module Graph defines the concept graph (see

  # distinguish between IncidenceGraph, EdgeListGraph and VertexListGraph
  # concept, which would complicate
  # the interface two much. These concepts are defined in BGL to differentiate
  # between efficient access to edges and vertices.
  # 
  # The RGL Graph concept contains only few requirements that are common to all
  # the graph
  # concepts. These include especially the iterators defining the set of
  # vertices and edges (see each_vertex and each_adjacent). Most other functions
  # are derived from these fundamental iterators, i.e. num_vertices() or
  # num_edges().

  # BGL defines the concept BidirectionalGraph as follows:

  # efficient access to in-edges typically requires more storage space, and many
  # algorithms do not require access to in-edges. For undirected graphs this is
  # not an issue, since the in_edges() and out_edges() functions are the same,
  # they both return the edges incident to the vertex.
