# The DirectedAdjacencyGraph class implements a generalized adjacency list
# graph structure. An AdjacencyGraph is basically a two-dimensional structure,
# where each element of the first dimension represents a vertex, and each of
# the vertices contains a one-dimensional structure that is the list of all
# adjacent vertices.
#
# The class for representing the adjacency list of a vertex is by default a
# Set, but can be configured by the client when a AdjacencyGraph is created.
